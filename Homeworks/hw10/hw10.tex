This problem set includes problems $3b, 5b, 12$, and an extra problem from section $17.4$.

3) Use the division algorithm to find $q(x)$ and $r(x)$ such that $a(x) = q(x)b(x) + r(x)$ with $\deg r(x) < \deg b(x)$.

3b) $a(x) = 6x^4-2x^3+x^2-3x+1, b(x) = x^2 + x - 2$ in $\mathbb{Z}_7[x]$

\underline{Solution}: Performing long division, we have  $$\polylongdiv{6x^4-2x^3+x^2-3x+1}{x^2+x-2}$$

So we have that
\begin{align*}
	a(x) &= (6x^2-8x+21)(x^2+x-2) - 40x + 43 \\
	&= (6x^2+6x)(x^2+x-2) + 2x + 1.
\end{align*}

Thus $q(x) = 6x^2 + 6x$ and $r(x) = 2x + 1$. \qed \\

5) Find all of the zeros of the given polynomial.

5b) $p(x) := 3x^3-4x^2-x+4$ in $\mathbb{Z}_5$

\underline{Solution}: We first find a root of $p(x)$ by looking at $p(0), p(1), p(2), p(3)$, and $p(4)$. We see that
$\\p(0) = 4 \\
p(1) = 3 - 5 + 4 = 2 \\
p(2) = 24 - 16 + 2 = 10 \equiv 0 \\
p(3) = 81-36+1 \equiv 1-1+1 \equiv 1$ and \\
$p(4) = 3(64)-64 = 2(64) = 128 \equiv 3$. \\

So $x = 2$ is a root of $p(x)$. Performing the long division, we have that
$$ \polylongdiv{3x^3-4x^2-x+4}{x-2} $$
Note that $10 \equiv 0$ so $r(x) = 0$. Thus 
\begin{equation}
	p(x) = (3x^2+2x+3)(x-2)
\end{equation}

To further see that we cannot factorize this any more, we look to see the roots of $q(x) := (3x^2+2x+3)$ in $\mathbb{Z}_5$. We have that 
$\\q(0) = 3 \\
q(1) = 8 \equiv 3 \\
q(2) = 12 + 4 + 3 \equiv 19 \equiv 4 \\
q(3) = 3(9) + 6 + 3 = 27 + 9 = 36 \equiv 1 \\
q(4) = 3(16) + 8 + 3 \equiv 3(1) + 3 + 3 \equiv 4$ \\

So $q(x)$ cannot be factorized any much. Thus we see that the only factorization of $p(x)$ in $\mathbb{Z}_5$ is as seen in equation $(1)$. Hence the only root of $p(x)$ is $x = 2$. \qed \\

12) If $F$ is a field, show that $F[x_1, \cdots, x_n]$ is an integral domain.

\underline{Proof}: Note that since $F$ is a field, $F$ is also an integral domain. Recall by definition we have that $$F[x_1, x_2] = (F[x_1])[x_2].$$ Without loss of generality, we will assume that $F[x_1, x_2]$ is the same as $F[x_2, x_1]$. We now proceed by induction.

i) Base Case: $n = 1$ \\
By Corollary R19 in class, we immediately have that $F[x_1]$ is an integral domain.

ii) Induction Step \\
Assume that $F[x_1, \cdots, x_{n-1}]$ is an integral domain. Then we show that $F[x_1 \cdots x_n]$ is an integral domain. We have that
$$ F[x_1, \cdots, x_n] = \big( F[x_1, \cdots ,x_{n-1}] \big) [x_n].$$

Note that $\big(F[x_1, \cdots ,x_{n-1}]\big)$ is an integral domain and adjoining another variable, $x_n$, still makes $F[x_1, \cdots ,x_n]$ an integral domain by the induction hypothesis. \qed \\

E1) Write $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{7}]$ as a quotient ring of the polynomial ring $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ and then use this to find a familiar ring isomorphic to
$$\frac{\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{7}]}{<8-\sqrt{7}>}.$$

\underline{Solution}:
